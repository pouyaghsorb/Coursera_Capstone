    "Denmark is a Scandinavian country located in the north of Europe and is known as one of the big leading nations toward green mobility and the reduction of fossil fuel consumption. Using bikes is one of the most common movements toward a green community in Denmark. In fact, nearly 60% of Danish people use bike for their daily needs [1] Here I have provided some of the main reasons I assume that have made bikes very useful in Denmark:"

    "Based on DTU website, there are currently 12894 active students studying in the technical university of Denmark (DTU) [2], which is one of the most famous engineering universities in the Europe with the QS world University ranking of 103 [3] When it comes to students, financial aspects become one of the most crucial points. However, there are two issues I have faced as a student in DTU:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>There is high price of bike services(it can be around 300 dkk for a normal service) [4]</li>\n",
    "<li>There are not sufficient service points around DTU</li>\n",
    "<li>There is a time limit</li>\n",

Some areas are not covered by the public transport after some hours of the day (for example after 8 pm), imagine you face an issue in your bike. what can you do?? :)"

My suggestion is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>having low peices means lower profit, but in a community of nearly 13000 people (students of DTU), even a profit of one cent can be very big</li>\n",
    "<li>Providing remote services. Many of us have seen small vending machines in the metro stations and so on, that provide some small services like drinks, chips and so on. why not having the same thing for bike services?</li>\n",
    "<li>DTU has different sections inside the campus that provides tools such as wrench, keys and so on(24h), so, just providing a vending machine that has some very basic things such as lights, tubes, tires, and so on can be amazingly handy for emergency situations</li>\n",
    "<li>despite a normal vending machine that requires cooling systems, normal bike facilities can be exempt of that, so no specific design would be required</li>\n",
